## GitHub GameOff Disclaimer

Most of this game was created during October 2022. I wanted to take part in GitHub GameOff, but sadly didn't have enough time to create a new game. I'm submitting this one and I hope this is still in the spirit of the competition since it was created pretty much within one month. You be the judge. :)

## Status

Playable, with a long list of ideas and TODOs in the code. There are just two levels right now.

## How to play

* Player 1: <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move, <kbd>Space</kbd> to shoot
* Player 2: <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>→</kbd> to move, <kbd>Enter</kbd> to shoot

Shoot enemies and avoid bullets.

Collect power-ups to evolve your airplane!
